# &#x2615; Welcome to "Country of the Temple" project

Now we can guess from which country a temple is based on its picture! For this purpose, a predictive model was created from [this dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ccqGu9r815WvgHAlG2CujzUPOEW_Pvo9/view?usp=sharing) and it is available here.

# &#x1f4c8; Data Analysis and Predictive Model

The detailed walkthough about the dataset analysis (ie: samples plots, insights) and the predictive model creation (ie: neural network architecture, choice of metrics, training and performance) are detailed on [this notebook](https://git.toptal.com/screening/diogo-dutra-2/-/blob/master/notebook/temple_country_pytorch.ipynb).

# &#128187; Standalone script

The predictive model to tell the country of origin is [available here](https://git.toptal.com/screening/diogo-dutra-2/-/blob/master/temple_country.py) to run as a standalone Python script over all images in a folder. It is assumed that the environment is properly setup with all necessary modules installed (Python, NumPy, Torch, Torchvision and Pandas). It is also necessary to download the model parameters [from here](https://git.toptal.com/screening/diogo-dutra-2/-/tree/master/model) to a local subfolder named `model`. Then, you can run it from the terminal:
```
python temple_country.py ./folder_images 
```
The result is in the `results.csv` file created at the same location of `temple_country.py` file.
